# Horiseon
This project is a refactoring of existing code to improve upon an already designed webpage. The motivation for this was to make the page more accessible, navigate easier, load easier, and simplify the code. Background picture was reduced in size to load more quickly. Redundant code was combined. Alts were added for each picture to make the page more accessible to those who require screen readers.
This project taught me about the process of debugging existing code, and I learned to see a webpage from the perspective of technical functionality rather than purely aesthetic. 

Below is a link to the deployed application.
